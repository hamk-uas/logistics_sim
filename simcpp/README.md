# SimCpp

SimCpp is a discrete event simulation framework for C++.
It aims to be a port of [SimPy](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
It is based on [Protothreads](http://dunkels.com/adam/pt) and a [C++ port of Protothreads](https://github.com/benhoyt/protothreads-cpp).

## Minimal Example

```c++
#include "simcpp.h"

class Car : public simcpp::Process {
public:
  explicit Car(simcpp::SimulationPtr sim) : Process(sim) {}

  bool Run() override {
    auto sim = this->sim.lock();

    PT_BEGIN();

    printf("Car running at %g.\n", sim->get_now());
    PROC_WAIT_FOR(sim->timeout(5.0));
    printf("Car running at %g.\n", sim->get_now());

    PT_END();
  }
};

int main() {
  auto sim = simcpp::Simulation::create();
  sim->start_process<Car>();
  sim->run();

  return 0;
}
```

This example can be compiled with `g++ -Wall -std=c++11 example-minimal.cpp simcpp.cpp -o example.minimal`.
When executed with `./example-minimal`, it produces the following output:

```text
Car running at 0.
Car running at 5.
```

## Installation

To use SimCpp, you need the files `simcpp.cpp`, `simcpp.h`, and `protothread.h`.
Whenever you want to use SimCpp in a file, include it with `#include "simcpp.h"`.
When compiling your program, you have to include the `simcpp.cpp` file.

## Getting Started

A SimCpp simulation is created by calling `simcpp::Simulation::create();`.
This returns a shared pointer to an instance of `simcpp::Simulation` to simplify memory management.
In this simulation, one or more processes have to be started to actually do things.
This is done with `sim->start_process<MyProcessClass>()`.

Each process is modeled as a subclass of `simcpp::Process`.
The behavior of a process is implemented in its `Run` method.
The `Run` method should start with (optional) variable declarations, followed by `PT_BEGIN();`, the behavior code, and finally `PT_END();`.

In between `PT_BEGIN();` and `PT_END();` you can use `PROC_WAIT_FOR(...);` to wait for events.
Events can be created with `sim->event()` or `sim->timeout(...)`.
These methods will be explained later.
Processes are events as well, so you can start new processes and wait for their completion using `PROC_WAIT_FOR(...);` too.

The `sim` class attribute is a weak pointer to the simulation instance to prevent cyclic references.
Never permanently store shared pointers to the simulation inside your processes!
The local variables of the `Run` method are reset after (most) calls to `PROC_WAIT_FOR`, so keeping a shared pointer to the simulation instance in the local variable `sim` is acceptable (this is done via `auto sim = this->sim.lock()` in the above example).
This also means that you have to use class attributes instead of local variables to keep state across calls to `PROC_WAIT_FOR`.

As stated before, `auto event = sim->event()` can be used to create new events.
Again, this returns a shared pointer to an instance of `simcpp::Event` to simplify memory management.
Initially, the returned event is pending.
When calling `PROC_WAIT_FOR(event);` with a pending event, the process is paused.

By calling `event->trigger()`, the event is triggered.
This means that all processes waiting for the event are resumed.
When calling `PROC_WAIT_FOR(event);` with a triggered event, nothing special happens.

When calling `auto event = sim->timeout(5)`, a pending event is returned too.
However, this event is automatically triggered after 5 timesteps.
Thus, if you write `PROC_WAIT_FOR(sim->timeout(5))`, the process is paused for 5 timesteps.

To check the current simulation time, you can use `sim->get_now()`.
Initially, it will return 0, but it will increase when the simulation is run.
To run the simulation, use `sim->run()`.
This runs the simulation until no further events are scheduled to be triggered.
It is also possible to run the simulation for a specific duration with `sim->advance_by(100)` (in this case, the simulation is advanced by 100 timesteps).

Now you should know all the basics to write your discrete event simulation with SimCpp.

## API

### Creating the simulation

```c++
simcpp::SimulationPtr sim = simcpp::Simulation::create();
// or
std::shared_ptr<simcpp::Simulation> sim2 = simcpp::Simulation::create();
```

### Starting processes

Construct the `MyProcess` process with two additional arguments and run it:

*The `MyProcess` instance is returned.*

```c++
std::shared_ptr<MyProcess> process = sim->start_process<MyProcess>(arg1, arg2);
```

Construct the `MyProcess` process with two additional arguments and run it after the given delay:

*The `MyProcess` instance is returned.*

```c++
std::shared_ptr<MyProcess> = sim->start_process_delayed<MyProcess>(delay, arg1, arg2);
```

### Creating events

Construct an event:

```c++
simcpp::EventPtr event = sim->event();
// or
std::shared_ptr<simcpp::Event> event = sim->event();
```

Construct the custom `MyEvent` event with two additional arguments:

```c++
std::shared_ptr<MyEvent> event = sim->event<MyEvent>(arg1, arg2);
```

Construct a timeout event which is scheduled to be processed after the given delay:

```c++
simcpp::EventPtr event = sim->timeout(delay);
```

Construct an event which is triggered when any of the given events is processed:

```c++
simcpp::EventPtr event = sim->any_of({ event1, event2 });
```

Construct an event which is triggered when all of the given events are processed:

```c++
simcpp::EventPtr event = sim->all_of({ event1, event2 });
```

### Running the simulation

Run the simulation until no scheduled events are left:

```c++
sim->run();
```

Advance the simulation by the given duration:

```c++
sim->advance_by(duration);
```

Advance the simulation until the given event is triggered:

*Returns `true` if the event was triggered and `false` is the simulation stopped because the event was aborted or no scheduled events are left.*

```c++
bool ok = sim->advance_to(event);
```

Process the next scheduled event:

*Returns `true` if there was a scheduled event to be processed and `false` otherwise.*

```c++
bool ok = sim->step();
```

### Checking the simulation state

Get the current simulation time:

```c++
double now = sim->get_now();
```

Check whether a scheduled event is left:

```c++
bool has_next = sim->has_next();
```

Get the time at which the next event is scheduled:

*If no events are scheduled, this method throws an exception.*

```c++
double time = sim->peek_next_time();
```

### Changing the event state

Schedule the event to be processed:

*If the event was not pending, nothing is done.
Returns `true` if the event was pending, `false` otherwise.*

```c++
bool ok = event->trigger();
```

Schedule the event to be processed after the given delay:

*If the event was not pending, nothing is done.
Returns `true` if the event was pending, `false` otherwise.*

```c++
bool ok = event->trigger(delay);
```

Abort the event:

*If the event was not pending, nothing is done.
Otherwise, calls the `Abort` callback of the event / process.
Returns `true` if the event was pending, `false` otherwise.*

```c++
bool ok = event->abort();
```

### Checking the event state

Check whether the event is pending:

```c++
bool pending = event->is_pending();
```

Check whether the event is triggered:

*This also returns `true` if the event is already processed.*

```c++
bool triggered = event->is_triggered();
```

Check whether the event is processed:

```c++
bool processed = event->is_processed();
```

Check whether the event is aborted:

```c++
bool aborted = event->is_aborted();
```

Get the state of an event:

*The state is one of `{Pending, Triggered, Processed, Aborted}`.*

```c++
simcpp::Event::State state = event->get_state();
```

### Waiting for events

Add a callback to be called when the event is processed:

*If the event was not pending, nothing is done.
Returns `false` if the event is triggered, `true` otherwise.*

```c++
bool ok = event->add_handler(callback);
```

Pause the process until the event is processed:

*If the event is aborted, the process is paused indefinitely.
If the event is triggered or processed, the process is not paused.*

```c++
PROC_WAIT_FOR(handler);
```

### Subclassing `simcpp::Event`

The `simcpp::Event` class can be subclassed to create custom event classes.
Custom events can take additional arguments in their constructor, store attributes, offer methods, and override the `Aborted` callback.
Note that the `sim` attribute is only a weak pointer to the simulation instance.
It must be converted to a shared pointer first to use it (`sim.lock()`).
Never store a shared pointer to the simulation instance as a permanent class attribute, this leads to cyclic references and therefore memory leaks.

```c++
class MyEvent : public simcpp::Event {
public:
  MyEvent(simcpp::SimulationPtr sim, int arg1, int arg2) : Event(sim) {}

  void Aborted() override {
    // ...
  }
}
```

### Subclassing `simcpp::Process`

The `simcpp::Process` class can be subclassed to create process classes.
Custom processes can take additional arguments in their constructor, store attributes, offer methods, and override the `Run` method and `Aborted` callback.
Note that the `sim` attribute is only a weak pointer to the simulation instance.
It must be converted to a shared pointer first to use it (`sim.lock()`).
Never store a shared pointer to the simulation instance as a permanent class attribute, this leads to cyclic references and therefore memory leaks.

```c++
class MyProcess : public simcpp::Process {
public:
  MyProcess(simcpp::SimulationPtr sim, int arg1, int arg2) : Process(sim) {}

  bool Run() override {
    simcpp::SimulationPtr sim = this->sim.lock();

    PT_BEGIN();
    // ...
    PT_END();
  }

  void Aborted() override {
    // ...
  }
}
```
