# Logistics simulation and optimization

A demo of simulation and optimization of glass waste pickup from Rinki sites in the area of the following municipalities in Finland: H채meenlinna, Hattula, Janakkala, Hausj채rvi, Riihim채ki, Loppi, Tammela, Forssa, Jokioinen.

Recyclable glass waste from consumers is constantly accumulating in a number of collection sites ("pickup sites", blue dots on the map), each with a given capacity in tons. Waste is collected and transported to each terminal (red stars) by a truck ("vehicle") starting and finishing their daily 9-hour shift at that terminal. A vehicle can only pick up waste equal to its capacity before it must return to the terminal. Picking up waste at a pickup site takes 15 minutes. Two weeks of waste transportation traffic is simulated, with the routes (as daily lists of pickup sites for each vehicle) optimized by a genetic algorithm utilizing a simulator to calculate and minimize a cost function that depends on the routing. A monetary cost is calculated based on fuel consumption, overtime work, and daily penalties for overfull pickup sites.

## Prerequisites

The Python version used is Python 3.10.4.

The Python modules listed in [`/requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) are needed. You can install them by:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

You need an API key to https://openrouteservice.org/. The key should be stored in `/waste_pickup_sim_secrets.py` in the following format (replace # characters with your key):

`API_key = '########################################################'`

## Compilation and running

### Routing optimizer

To compile the routing optimizer in Windows or Linux:

`g++ routing_optimizer.cpp simcpp/simcpp.cpp -std=c++17 -march=native -I. -O3 -ffast-math -fopenmp -o routing_optimizer`

### Simulation

To run the simulation:

`python routing_optimizer_test.py`
